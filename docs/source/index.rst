Welcome to Rakam Systems' Documentation!
=========================================

**Rakam Systems** is a Python library designed to provide an integrated solution for creating **Vector Stores** and building **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** systems. It offers a modular architecture to support search, content extraction, and large language model (LLM)-driven tasks, such as text classification and RAG-enabled prompt generation.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.

Key Features
------------

- **Vector Store Management**: Create, manage, and search through vector stores using embeddings for efficient retrieval.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines vector store retrieval and large language model (LLM) generation.
- **Content Extraction**: Extracts content from various file formats such as PDF, URLs, and JSON files.
- **Node Processing**: Processes text data for optimized storage and retrieval.
- **Modular Action-Based Agents**: Supports actions like query classification and custom RAG generation using agents.

Installation
------------

Before getting started, ensure you have installed the necessary dependencies. See the :doc:`installation` section for instructions.

----------

Usage Guide
-----------

This library supports a variety of operations, including:

- **Creating and managing Vector Stores** for fast, vector-based content retrieval.
- **Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to generate LLM-based responses.
- **Extracting content** from PDFs, URLs, and JSON files for processing.
- **Processing content into nodes** for efficient querying and storage.

Refer to the :doc:`usage` section for detailed examples and code snippets on how to use these features.
